## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run FraudShield locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or Yarn
*   A Supabase project

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Oluwat-dev/FraudShild.git
    cd fraudshield
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase**:
    *   Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
    *   Navigate to `Project Settings` -> `API`.
    *   Copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
    *   Navigate to `Project Settings` -> `API Keys` and copy your `service_role` key.
    *   Navigate to `Database` -> `SQL Editor` and run the SQL migration files located in `supabase/migrations/` in chronological order. These migrations set up your tables, RLS policies, and database functions.
    *   Navigate to `Edge Functions` and deploy the functions located in `supabase/functions/`. You will need to set up environment variables for these functions:
        *   `SUPABASE_URL` (your project URL)
        *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (your service role key)
        *   `RESEND_API_KEY` (your Resend API key for email notifications)

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Supabase credentials:

    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

# üõ°Ô∏è FraudShield

FraudShield is an intelligent fraud detection and prevention system powered by Supabase and machine learning. This repository outlines the core architecture, database schema, fraud detection logic, and deployment process.

---

## üìä Database Schema

FraudShield's database is powered by **PostgreSQL** via **Supabase**. Key tables include:

- **`users`**: Stores user-specific data, including their balance.
- **`transactions`**: Records all financial transactions, including:
  - amount
  - merchant
  - category
  - risk score
  - fraud status
- **`fraud_cases`**: Manages reported fraud incidents, links them to specific transactions, and tracks resolution status.

The schema also includes:

- Custom **enums**:
  - `transaction_status`
  - `fraud_case_status`
- PostgreSQL **functions** for business logic and data integrity:
  - `transfer_money`
  - `validate_recipient_email`
  - `update_user_balance`
  - `handle_new_user`
  - `update_updated_at_column`

---

## üß† Fraud Detection Model

The core of FraudShield's intelligence lies in its conceptual fraud detection model.

- The current implementation (`src/lib/fraudModel.ts`) uses a simplified **TensorFlow.js** model for demonstration.
- The **`process-transaction`** Supabase Edge Function is responsible for:
  - Receiving transaction data.
  - Calculating a `risk_score` based on amount, category, location, device info, etc.
  - Determining if a transaction is `is_fraudulent`.
  - Inserting the transaction into the `transactions` table.
  - Updating sender and recipient balances (for P2P transfers).

---

## üöÄ Deployment

FraudShield can be easily deployed:

- **Frontend**: Deploy the React app to static hosting platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**. üîó You can access the application [here](https://jade-faun-7da1f3.netlify.app/)

- **Backend**: The **Supabase** project handles:
  - Database
  - Authentication
  - Edge Functions (automatically deployed when pushed)
